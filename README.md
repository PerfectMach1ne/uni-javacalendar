# JavaCalendar
My Swing desktop application project for an undergrad class in Java programming. It's a calendar with a week view and ability to add and remove events to it.

**21/05/2022 update**
I give up lol Swing and this app's GUI and event implementation is too dreadful to navigate through. Was a good learning experience, though.
### My plans/ToDo list
~~1. Complete GUI rewrite (there's lots of brutal Swing misuse in this project for me to rid of, also I'd like to try making the window resizeable).
2. Implementation of years, months & weeks display, as well as a way to "scroll" through different weeks of the year.
3. A way to save and load the events.
4. A local relational database containing the events.[^1]~~



[^1]: Originally I wanted to include a database connection back when I first started working on this project, as it was a requirement for my class. However, I ran out of time, but I still want to do that for pure practice.
