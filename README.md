# JavaCalendar
My Swing desktop application project for an undergrad class in Java programming. It's a calendar with a week view and ability to add and remove events to it.

I give up lol Swing and this app's GUI and event implementation is too dreadful to navigate through. Was a good learning experience, though.

Might consider returning to this project someday, though instead of continuing work on this app I would rather start it over with JavaFX or some Web framework.

### ~~My plans/ToDo list~~
1. ~~Complete GUI rewrite (there's lots of brutal Swing misuse in this project for me to rid of, also I'd like to try making the window resizeable).~~
2. ~~Implementation of years, months & weeks display, as well as a way to "scroll" through different weeks of the year.~~
3. ~~A way to save and load the events.~~
4. ~~A local relational database containing the events.[^1]~~



[^1]: Originally I wanted to include a database connection back when I first started working on this project, as it was a requirement for my class. However, I ran out of time, but I still want to do that for pure practice.
