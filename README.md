# JavaCalendar
My Swing desktop application project for an undergrad class in Java programming. It's a calendar with a week view and ability to add and remove events to it.

#### There's no 'Build and run' section, because I'm still clueless about building Java executables.

#### I'm going to be expanding this file little by little as I clean up the code, learn what I did wrong and how to improve it.
